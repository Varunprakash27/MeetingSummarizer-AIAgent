[Alice]: Hi everyone, thanks for joining. Today we'll review our Q2 marketing goals and finalize plans for the upcoming product launch.
[Bob]: Sounds good. I've pulled data from last quarter—our email campaign had a 12% open rate, which is below target.
[Carol]: Agreed. We might need to adjust the content strategy or segment better.
[Dave]: Also, our social engagement on Instagram dropped by 20%.
[Alice]: Action item: Bob, can you analyze email open rates by segment and report back next week?
[Bob]: Sure, I’ll get that done.
[Carol]: I’ll also look into potential influencer partnerships to boost social engagement.
[Alice]: Great. One more thing—let’s aim to finalize the product launch date by Friday.
[Dave]: Got it. I’ll sync with the product team and propose a date tomorrow.
[Alice]: Perfect. Thanks, everyone. Meeting adjourned.
